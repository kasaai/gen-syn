  title = {Modeling {{Tabular}} Data Using {{Conditional GAN}}},
  abstract = {Modeling the probability distribution of rows in tabular data and generating realistic synthetic data is a non-trivial task. Tabular data usually contains a mix of discrete and continuous columns. Continuous columns may have multiple modes whereas discrete columns are sometimes imbalanced making the modeling difficult. Existing statistical and deep neural network models fail to properly model this type of data. We design TGAN, which uses a conditional generative adversarial network to address these challenges. To aid in a fair and thorough comparison, we design a benchmark with 7 simulated and 8 real datasets and several Bayesian network baselines. TGAN outperforms Bayesian methods on most of the real datasets whereas other deep learning methods could not.},

We explore these methods, discuss their calibration and study their predictive power on an explicit motor third-party liability insurance data set. The results of the case study show that a simple generalized linear model does not capture interactions of feature components appropriately, whereas the other methods are able to address these interactions.},
